# Bloxflip Auto Rain

Bloxflip Auto Rain is a userscript designed to enhance the experience on [Bloxflip.com](https://bloxflip.com) by automatically notifying users of "rain" events and facilitating participation in these events. The script ensures that you never miss out on any rain, as it alerts you and joins the rain events automatically.

## Features

- **Automatic Notifications:** Get real-time notifications whenever a rain event starts.
- **Auto Join:** Automatically joins rain events after notification.
- **Easy to Use:** Runs entirely in the background with minimal setup.
